# KhazadBlockCipher
Khazad is a 64-bit (legacy-level) block cipher that acceptsa 128-bit key. The cipher is a uniform substitution-permutation networkwhose inverse only diﬀers from the forward operation in the key schedule.The overall cipher design follows the Wide Trail strategy, favours com-ponent reuse, and permits a wide variety of implementation tradeoﬀs.
